## Dynamic Emission Rates

**Waifu Pool (Image Generation)**

* Base rewards: 200,000 HEU tokens (2 bps of total supply) weekly

* Maximum dynamic rewards: Up to 500,000 HEU tokens (5 bps of total supply) weekly, based on the usage of image generation models

**Llama Pool (LLM)**

* Base rewards: 200,000 HEU tokens weekly

* Maximum dynamic rewards: Up to 500,000 tokens weekly, based on the usage of LLMs

The base rewards ensure that miners are guaranteed to earn rewards regardless of network usage. This ensures a baseline level of compute resources in the network. **The dynamic rewards will be determined by organic (non-bot) demand for AI inference compute.** Weâ€™ll provide dashboards to display this data collected from our inference APIs. This allows the compute power of Heurist network to scale up as more compute demand is onboarded.

## Weekly Snapshots

We take weekly snapshots. This means Waifu and Llama points in Season 2 will be converted to Heurist Token balances every week. This provides clear reward visibility, prevents point hyperinflation, and helps miners to project their rewards.

## Token Claim Timeline

Season 2 rewards will be claimable when (1) Heurist ZK Chain goes live (2) 3 months after TGE, whichever comes first.
